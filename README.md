# Virtual Tourist

Virtual Tourist is part of Udacity's iOS Nanodegree course. It allows you to place a pin anywhere in the world and will load a collection of Flicker photos using that location.

## Features
Virtual Tourist helps you travel the world with your iPhone! Pressing on any point in the map will show you what people find interesting about that place through pictures. It will also persist the pictures and locations to your phone using [CoreData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata) so they will load quicker and can be viewed offline.

## Requirements
* Xcode 10.2.1
* Swift 5.0
* Deployment Target: iOS 12.2
